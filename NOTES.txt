Chose Kingfisher over AsyncImage because of AsyncImage limitations.
This is a small choice that will future proof the app more in the case
that more granular control is needed.
I chose Kingfisher over others because it is the most battle tested.
We can always optimize later, but it's good to have the best in class out of the gate.
